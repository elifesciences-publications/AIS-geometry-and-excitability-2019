# AIS diameter vs soma diameter in a variety of cell types.

These the data included in figure 4 of the paper that shows the diameter of the AIS vs the diameter of the soma for different cell types.

To plot the figure 4: figure_4.py

The data used include three sets of measurements for individual neurons (digitized from original figures):
- human spinal motoneurons 
(Sasaki S, Maruyama S. 1992. Ultrastructural study of skein-like inclusions in anterior horn neurons of patients with motor neuron disease. 
Neuroscience Letters 147:121–124.): sasaki-murayama.py plots the data (sasaki-murayama-1992-Fig2.csv)
- cat spinal motoneurons 
(Conradi S, Ronnevi L-O. 1977. Ultrastructure and synaptology of the initial axon segment of cat spinal motoneurons during early postnatal development. 
J Neurocytol 6:195–210.): conradi-ronnevi.py plots the data (conradi-ronnevi-1977.csv)
- pyramidal and stellate cortical cells  of primates 
(Sloper JJ, Powell TPS. 1979. A Study of the Axon Initial Segment and Proximal Axon of Neurons in the Primate Motor and Somatic Sensory Cortices. 
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series B, Biological Sciences 285:173–197.): sloper-powell.py plots the data (slower-powell-1979-Fig71.txt)

It also includes average AIS and soma diameter for other cell types, listed in table 3 of the paper.

For two papers, the averages were obtained from the digitized data: 
- Buckmaster PS. 2012. Mossy cell dendritic structure quantified and compared with other hippocampal neurons labeled in rats in vivo. 
Epilepsia 53:9–17: buckmaster-2012.xlsx 
- Kosaka T. 1980. The axon initial segment as a synaptic site: Ultrastructure and synaptology of the initial segment of the pyramidal cell in the rat hippocampus (CA3 region).
